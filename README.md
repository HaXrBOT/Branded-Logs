"Branded Logs" is a simple mod that allows modpack creators to print additional information about the modpack into the logs of the game. Like the name of the modpack and its version in addition to information about the users machine, operating system, java version and ram allocation.

So how do you use it?
1. Create a directory like this: "./resources/modpack".
2. Create two TXT files inside. The first being for the name called "modpackname.txt" and the second being "modpackversion.txt" for the version of the modpack.
3. Make sure to avoid writing any spaces into the files as that will make the modpack name and version not show in the logs.

Greatly inspired by and somewhat based upon the '[Log More Info](https://github.com/FederAndInk/log_more_info)https://github.com/FederAndInk/log_more_info' mod.
